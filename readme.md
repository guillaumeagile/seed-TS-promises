Seed for Test Driven Development with Typescript 4 (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) Chai and Node.
Mocha and Jest are used for testing.



Installation:
to grad all libs:
npm i  


HOWEVER it's recommended to install TypeScript globally:
```
npm i typescript -g
```
and then other necessary librairies
```
npm i chai -D
npm i mocha -D
npm i @types/chai -D
npm i @types/mocha -D
npm i ts-mocha -D
npm i typescript -D
```

Run:
```
npm run build
npm run test
```

This would watch source and test files for changes and execute the tests.
